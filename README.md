# Trialogue
thesis project -- Trialogue is an inter-media game performance that transforms the process of game creation, playing and experiencing it into a playful tug-of-war of control, caught in a cultural and economic system which seeks to reinforce the status quo. Arranged as an installation crossing multiple media, participants embody three roles — a Developer who modifies a game in real-time while it’s being interacted by a Player. At the same time, a third participant embodies the Character who is experiencing the game in virtual reality from Player’s first-person point of view struggling to express their agency. Based on an audience-controlled evaluation of the overall performance, the Developers’ modifying powers will be altered and thus will the nature of the installation.

Trialogue is currently being made as my MFA Thesis at NYU Game Center and is scheduled to be completed by May 2016.

Features:

*    Interactive installation exploring the processes embodied by the three roles involved within ;the “textual” boundaries of a game
*    Observing the effects of an experience of a game when modified in real-life
*    Physical separation of the performed roles in the installation space allows only for indirect, non-verbal communication
*    Explores how design of tools and game engine frame the creation processes
*    A “fake economy” which rewards the Developer with more power if they satisfy Good Game Design Principles and get positive evaluation from the audience members
*    Critique of game industry and culture’s influence on defining the processes
*    Explores the agency and embodiment of human body interrogating with virtual reality
